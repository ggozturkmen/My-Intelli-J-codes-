What is inheritance:
Its a mechanism through which a class can inherit the properties of another class.
Why we sould lear: It helps us avoid code duplication. It helps us save space.
It helps us improve execution speed.
What is the syntax:
we use the extends keyword and the name of the class from which we want to inhrerir the fields ans methodd while declaring the class.
Types of inheritance:
There can be 4 types of inheritance but java only supports 3 of them in classes.
there xan be 4 types of inheritance but java only supports 3 of them with classes.
1)single
2)multilevel
3)hiarrarhical
4)multiple(not supported by classes in java.)
Single inheritance:When we have only one parent and one child classes in inheritance it is called single inheritance. not widely used
Multileve
; on top level and one base class and many intermadiate classes


Super keyweos;
We use the super keyword to explicity call the variable from the parent class. when we have same name instance varaible in child class and parent class.

we can also use the super keyword to ca;; constructor of the parent class.
==============================================
MethodOVERLOADING=Method over loading allows us to create multiple methods in a class with same name.
Why we should create;it helps us write cleaner code.
Syntax:create different methods but kepp the following points in mind.
we can overload a method by changing the data type of a paramter;
we can overload a method by changing the sequance
dataType method name(parameter)

it gives the end user flexibility.
The end user can call same method with different parameter to get same or different result.

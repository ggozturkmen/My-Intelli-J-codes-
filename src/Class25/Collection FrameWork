Collection FrameWork:

is collection of multiple classses and interfaces which help us process data efficiently and easily.
Why we should learn about it when we aleady have arrays;
it is flexible
provide ready made methods that we can just use
Syntax:
It is similar how we create the object of any class but we use<>spisify the name of the clas whos objects we are going to store in that class.
Issues with Collections Framework;
collection frame work does not work with primitive data types(Solution is use wrapper classes
)
Wrapper classes:
are object types for all primitive types.
Boxing: converting the primitive type to its corresponding wrapper type
//Frequently asked interview questions
Auto boxing: converting the primitive type to its corresponding wrapper type simply assigning the value
//Unboxing

Converting a wrapper to its corresponding primitive type by expilicity calling a method
//int num=wrapped.intValue();

//Auto Unboxing;
converting a wrapper to a corresponding primitive automaticallay by just assigning the valur

Integer wrappedNum=new Integer(10);
int num2=WrappedNum;
